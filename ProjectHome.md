**The free guide to Wicket is now officially part of the Apache Project! Although the current guide on this site will continue to be available, it won't be maintained anymore and you may use the official guide at the main site http://wicket.apache.org.
The guide is available both as HTML format and as pdf file.
I would like to express my most heartfelt thanks to anyone who supported the project and contributed to its success!**<br />

# Overview #

Wicket framework has been around since 2004 and it's an Apache project since 2007. During these years it has proved to be a solid and valuable solution for building enterprise web applications.
Wicket core developers have done a wonderful job with this framework and they continue to improve it release after release.

However Wicket never provided a freely available documentation and even if you can find on Internet many live examples and many technical articles on it (most of them at http://www.wicket-library.com/ and at http://wicketinaction.com/), the lack of an organized and freely available documentation has always been a sore point for this framework.
That's quite an issue as many other popular frameworks (like Spring, Hibernate or Struts) offer a vast and very good documentation which substantially contributed to their success.

This project is an attempt to fill this void providing a free guide to the framework that should significantly reduce its learning curve.
The guide is aimed at both beginners and more advanced users of this framework.

The various Wicket-related topics are gradually introduced using pragmatic examples of code that you
can find at https://github.com/bitstorm/Wicket-tutorial-examples.

The Wicket version covered in the guide is the 6.x

## Project update: 2013-09-04 ##

I'm happy to announce that the Wicket core Team has decided to include the Wicket Free Guide as official documentation for the project. Thanks to anyone for having contributed to this result! <br />
In future, the guide will be shared in a more code-friendly format (for example a markup language) and hosted (most likely) on GitHub to easily collect contributions from other readers.

Stay tuned!

PS: in the meantime, the guide is also **available as on-line documentation** [here](http://wicketguide.comsysto.com). This version includes a new **Best Practices** chapter.<br />
PPS:for those who are interested in REST architecture, I've implemented a WicketStuff module to use Wicket to implement REST API/services in much the same way as we do with Spring MVC or with the standard JAX-RS. More details and documentation [here](https://github.com/wicketstuff/core/tree/master/jdk-1.6-parent/wicketstuff-restannotations-parent).

## Last update: 2013-05-30 ##
Many corrections to the document. The most remarkable changes are:
  * Proofreading and correction of the document from preface to chapter 10. Thanks to Paul Bors!
  * Paragraph '10.2.5 Creating custom validators' has been partially rewritten to remove deprecated code (class AbstractValidator)

## Source repository online...again!: 2013-05-08 ##
The examples repository couldn't have been accessed due to a problem with GitHub. Now it should be available again.

  * Fixed typo in the footnote 9 in chapter 4.1
  * Corrected the exception mentioned in the note box at the end of paragraph 2.3
  * Added a revision date on the cover page

## Last update: 2013-04-08 ##
  * Fixed some typos/spelling errors
  * Added a paragraph on resource dependencies (paragraph 13.5)
  * Added a note box about the default 'resources' folder (at the end of paragraph 13.9)
